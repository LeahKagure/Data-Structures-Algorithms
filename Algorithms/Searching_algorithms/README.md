**Searching Algorithms**

These algorithms search for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

Searching algorithms are classified into two categories:
1. **Sequential search** - The list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. An example is *linear search*

2. **Interval search** - This is designed for searching in sorted data structures. It is more efficient compared to linear search as it repeatedly targets the center of the structure to be searched and divides the search space into half
