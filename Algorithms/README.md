**Algorithms**

This directory contains Algorithms used in Computer Programming.

Algorithms can be defined as a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem. They help to perform a task in programming in order to get the desired output.
Algorithms are language-independent.

**Characteristics of an algorithm**
1. It is clear and unambiguous
2. Well defined inputs
3. Well defined outputs
4. Finite-ness
5. Feasible
6. Language independent

**Properties of an algorithm**
1. Should terminate after a finite time
2. Should produce at least one output
3. Should take zero or more input
4. Should be deterministic
5. Every step must be effective

**Types of algorithms**
Some types of algorithms include: *Bruteforce algorithm, Recursive algorithm, Backtracking algorithm, Searching algorithm, Sorting algorithm, Hashing algorithm, Divide & conquer algorithm, Greedy algorithm, Dynamic programming and Randomized algorithm.* 

**Advantages of algorithms**
1. Easy to understand
2. An algorithm is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem
3. In an algorithm the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps hence, easier for the programmer to convert it to an actual program
4. Easy to debug/ error finding

**Disadvantages of agorithms**
1. Writing an algorithm is time consuming
2. Understanding complex logic through algorithms can be very difficult
3. Branching and looping statements are difficult to show in algorithms

**How to design an algorithm**
1. Determine the *problem* that is to be solved by the algorithm
2. Considering the *constraints* of the problem while solving it
3. Determine the *input* to be taken to solve the problem
4. Determine the expected *output* when the problem is solved
5. Ensuring the *solution* to the problem is within the given constraints

**How to analyze an algorithm**
1. *Priori analysis* - 'Priori' means before. This analysis means checking the algorithm before its implementation
2.*Posterior analysis* - 'Posterior' means after. This analysis means checking the algorithm after its implementation

**Algorithm complexity and how to find it**
An algorithm is defined as complex, based on the amount of space and time it consumes.
**Two factors of algorithm complexity**
1. *Time factor* - Time is measured by counting the number of key operators i.e comparisons in the sorting algorithm
2. *Space factor* - Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm
**Complexity of an algorithm**
1. *Space complexity* is calculated by determining the fixed part and variable part
2. *Time complexity* is calculated by determining the constant time part and the variable time part
Extra space is also known as *auxiliary space*

**Classification of algorithms**
1. *Implementation method* - Recursive or iteration, exact or approximate, serial or parallel or distributed algorithms
2. *Design method* - Greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, linear programming, reduction (transform and conquer), backtracking, branch and bound algorithms

**Two approaches for designing algorithms**
1. *Top-Down approach
2. *Botton-Up approach
3. *Other classifications* : Randomized algorithms, classification by complexity, classification by research area, branch and bound enumeration and backtracking

**Importance of algorithm analysis**
1. To predict the behaviour of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer
2. It is convinient to have simple measures of an algorithm
3. It is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm
4. The analysis is only an approximation
5. By analyzing different algorithms, we can compare to determine the best one for our purpose

**Types of algorithm analysis**
1. Best case
2. Worst case
3. Average case
