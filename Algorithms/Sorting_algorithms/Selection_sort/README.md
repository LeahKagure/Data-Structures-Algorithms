**Selection Sort Algorithm**

It sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from an unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array, these are:

-The subarray which is already sorted

-The remaining subarray which is unsorted

In every iteration the minimum element from the unsorted subarray, is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

The time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is **0(N**2) because it has two nested loops

The space complexity of the algorithm is **0(1)**

The default implementation of the algorithm is not stable but it can however be made to be

The algorithm does not require extra space
