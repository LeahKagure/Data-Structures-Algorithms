**Data Structures**

This directory contains Data Structures used in Computer Programming.

A Data Structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so it can be accessed and efficiently uploaded.
A data structure is also used for: *Processing, Retrieving and Storing data*

A data structure is a collection of different kinds of data. The entire data can be represented using an object/structure which is to be used throughout the program

**Characteristics of Data Structures**
- It can hold multiple types of data within a single object
- Data structure implementation is known as *concrete implementation*
- In data structures objects, time complexity plays a very important role
- In data structures, the data and its value acquire space in the computer's main memory. A d.s. can hold varying kinds and types of data within a single object

Every developed program or software program used different basic and advanced types of data structures

**Classification of Data Structures**
1. **Linear Data Structure**
Data elements here are sequentially or linearly arranged, and each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent element.
Examples of linear data structures are: *array, stack, queue, linked list*

- *I)Static Data Structure*
It is a linear data structure that has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in it. An example is *an array*

- *II)Dynamic Data Structure*
In this linear d.s. the size is not fixed and it can randomly be updated during runtime which may be considered efficient in respect to the memory (space) complexity of the code.
An example is *Queue, Stack, linked list*

2. **Non-linear Data Structure**
Data elements here are not placed sequentially or linearly. All the elements cannot be traversed in a single run
An example is *Tree and Graph*

**Needs of Data Structures**
- The modification of data structure is easy
- It requires less time
- Saves storage and memory space
- Data representation is easy
- Easy access to the large database

**Applications of Data Strutures**
- Operating system
- Graphics
- Computer Design
- Blockchain
- Genetics
- Image processing
- Simulation

**Operations performed on different data structures**
- Traversing
- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion

Other methods include:
- create
- selection
- update
- sort
- merge
- split data
