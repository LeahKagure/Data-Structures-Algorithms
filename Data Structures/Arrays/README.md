**Arrays**
This folder contains all information on arrays as they are used in Computer Programming. The various concepts are explained and then demonstrated in form of a coded script.

**Definition**
An array is a collection of items stored in contiguous memory location. Multiple items of the same type are stored together.
The location of the next index depends on the data used. The size of an array in C, cannot be changed. *Expanding* doesn't mean that we can get the next memory location free. While *shrinking* is not possible because by declaring an array, memory gets statically allocated and the compiler is the only one that can destroy it.

**Types of indexing in an array**
1. Zero-based indexing
2. One-based indexing
3. N-based indexing

**Types of arrayys**
1. One-dimensional (1-D) arrays
2. Multi-dimensional arrays

**Advantages of using arrays**
1. They allows random access to elements
2. Arrays have a better cache locality
3. They represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name

**Disadvantages of using arrays**
1. The size of an array cannot be changed

**Applications of arrays**
1. They store data elements of the same data type
2. They are used when the size of the data set is known
3. They are used in solving matrix problems
4. They are applied as a lookup table ina  computer
5. Database records are also implemented by the array
6. Helps in implementing the sorting algorithm
7. Different variables of the same data type can be saved under one name
8. Arrays can be used for CPU scheduling
9. Arrays can be used to implement other data structures like; *Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash Tables*
